# I'm a bit later dot N L

[ikbenwatlater.nl](https://github.com/Bergvca/pyspark_dist_explore) (I'm a bit later dot N L) is a site
I created to notify you when your train is delayed or cancelled. Sign up, chose a trajectory and
times between which you want to be notified, and you will receive an email when your train is in trouble.

This will save you some time waiting at the train station. 

The site is build on google app engine, and uses the NS (dutch railroad) API to find delays.
